<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through two codelabs on Android Basics on layouts - `RecyclerView`, `MaterialCardView`, `GridLayoutManager` & `LinearLayoutManager`.

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning Android, and it feels nice to have basic understanding of how app layout works.

### Day 2: August 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished a codelab on testing layout and adapter. Building Dogglers app - still work in progress!

**Thoughts** Good refresher to remind myself about Android App Testing and `ConstraintLayout` mentioned in previous codelabs.
